This is a demo application that allows a user to search github repositories. 

It will:
1. Allow the user to enter a search term
1. Returns and displays the top 10 repos related to that search term (by stars)
1. Displays the items in a list allowing the user to delete items on the list
1. Displays the users search history



The project can be cloned from this repo and run with "yarn start" - to see testing run "yarn test"
