It will:
1. Allow the user to enter a search term
1. Returns and displays the top 10 repos related to that search term (by stars)
1. Displays the items in a list allowing the user to delete items on the list
1. Displays the users search history
1. Persists the users search history to local storage



The project can be cloned from this repo and run with "yarn" to install dependencies and then "yarn start"
